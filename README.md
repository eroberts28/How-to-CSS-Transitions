# How to CSS Transitions

## CSS Transitions

CSS3 transitions allows you to change property values smoothly (from one value to another), over a given duration.

An example of this is hovering your mouse over a button and the button enlarges and changes colour.

How to Use CSS3 Transitions?

To create a transition effect, you must specify two things:

* The CSS property you want to add an effect to 
* The duration of the effect

Note: If the duration part is not specified, the transition will have no effect, because the default value is 0.

I have created a tutorial to demonstrate how to use CSS Transitions: https://thimbleprojects.org/eroberts27/142540 along with my original presentation:https://github.com/eroberts28/CSSTricks
